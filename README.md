Blockchain Rush is an engaging, fast-paced game designed to introduce players to the basics of blockchain technology. 
Players align moving blocks of matching colors to build a chain, scoring points as they go. With each successful
alignment, the game speed increases, making it progressively challenging. The gameplay mirrors real blockchain dynamics
like transaction validation and network congestion, offering a fun and accessible way to learn about blockchain concepts through play.
